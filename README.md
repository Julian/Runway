# Runway

An Android launcher because I couldn't find one I liked previously.

## Building

Requires the Android SDK with platform 37 and a JDK 17 or newer on the path.
On macOS with only Android Studio installed, register its bundled JDK once:

```sh
ln -s "/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr" ~/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/android-studio-jbr.jdk
```

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

## Running

```sh
./gradlew installAsHome    # install the debug build, make it the home app, go home
```

Unit tests can be run via:

```sh
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

Debug builds use the application id `com.grayvines.runway.debug` so they can be installed alongside a release build without touching its layout.
